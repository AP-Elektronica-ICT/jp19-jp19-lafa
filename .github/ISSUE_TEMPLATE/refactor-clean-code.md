**Check style**
If you wish to do a pull request about a refactor. Then please follow our coding style.
If you aren't sure how that looks then take a look at our source code.

**Make sure it really is a refactor**
Don't waste everybody's time by making a pull request that only changes something visible like adding a newline or a tab. Please make sure that it adds something useful like comments, abstracting, following SOLID principles etc. Otherwise your pull request will be denied.

**Make sure you didn't broke anything**
Before making a pull request make sure your code compiles, didn't broke anything and if it made a change in setup/dependency don't forget to mention it. Otherwise your pull request will be closed
